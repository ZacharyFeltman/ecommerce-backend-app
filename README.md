# E-Commerce Back End ORM
For this assignment, I have created a back end ORM that allows the user to alter and view the information.  Using MySQL, Sequelize, and Insomnia, a user can view, add, edit, and delete objects in their E-Commerce website from the back end.

## Objectives

 - When I use USE ecommerce_db; the database is created through MySQL and using npm run seed, I have seeded my database with the information provided.
 - When I use Insomnia, I am able to run the commands that allow me to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE objects in the database.
 - When I open API GET routes in insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the user is presented with all of the seeded dates from the database.
 - When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia then all of those function as expected for each of those seeds in the database as well.
